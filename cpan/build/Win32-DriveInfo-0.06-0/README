NAME 

Win32::DriveInfo - drives on Win32 systems 


ABSTRACT 

With this module you can get total/free space on Win32 drives,
volume names, architecture, filesystem type, drive attributes, list
of all available drives and free drive-letters. Additional function
to determine Windows version info. 

The intention was to have a part of Dave Roth's Win32::AdminMisc
functionality on Win95/98. 

The current version of Win32::DriveInfo is available at: 

  http://base.dux.ru/guest/fno/perl/

INSTALLATION

As this is just a plain module no special installation is needed.
Just put it into /Win32 subdir somewhere in your @INC. The standard 

 Makefile.PL
 make
 make test
 make install

installation procedure is provided. In addition 

 make html

will produce the HTML-docs. 

This module requires 

Win32::API module by Aldo Calpini 

CAVEATS 

This module has been created and tested in a Win95 environment
on GS port of Perl 5.004_02. As it uses Win32::API module I expect
it would work fine with other ports like ActiveState if Win32::API
(API.dll) is compiled for this port.
